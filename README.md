# Guess My Number Game
The "Guess My Number" game is a classic JavaScript project that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. 
Here's how the game works:

Generating a Random Number: The game generates a random number between a specified minimum and maximum value. This number is the target that the player needs to guess.

Player Input: The player inputs their guess into an input field and submits it.

Checking the Guess: The game compares the player's guess to the target number:

If the guess is correct, the game displays a congratulatory message and ends.
If the guess is too high or too low, the game provides feedback to the player and allows them to continue guessing.
Feedback and Clues: To assist the player, the game may provide hints such as "Too high!" or "Too low!" based on the comparison between the guess and the target number.

Number of Attempts: Optionally, the game may keep track of the number of attempts the player makes to guess the correct number.

Game Over: The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or reaches a maximum number of attempts.

Resetting the Game: After the game ends, the player may have the option to reset the game to play again.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure and layout of the game interface.
CSS: For styling and visual enhancements.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, including generating the random number, handling user input, and providing feedback.
This "Guess My Number" game project serves as a fun and interactive way to practice JavaScript fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional statements. It's a great starting point for beginners learning JavaScript or for anyone looking to sharpen their skills through hands-on coding projects.
